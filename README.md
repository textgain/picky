# Picky
#### Simple app for manually annotating pictures
* One file (`picky.html`) contains all Javascript, CSS & HTML.
* Select multiple local images and tag them with the arrow keys (◀ ▶).
* Quickly process hundreds of images per hour this way.
* Use `TAB` & `BACKSPACE` to skip to next / previous image.
* Captions can be loaded from a JSON file (image filenames as keys, text as values).
* Once you're done, save annotations as a JSON file (downloads as `labels.json`).
* The file can be reloaded, to continue annotating.
* _Arrow keys not working? A field has the focus. Click on the image first._
